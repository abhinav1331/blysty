						<h3>About Blysty</h3>
						<p>Blysty is a place to create, save, and discover lists, whether for yourself or to share with the world. Everyone likes to make lists and Blysty gives you the perfect place to create lists, organize your lists, discover new lists, save them, and share them with the world of Blysters (Blyst users).</p>

						<p>Blysters discover new ideas from their home feed—or by browsing through categories or doing searches—that inspire them and that help them make their own lists better. Blysters find new lists—from restaurants to national parks to cars—that help them discover new things to do or try. Blysters find all kinds of ideas by hanging out on the Home Blysty Page or by exploring Blysty through the many ways you can search it. Without question, it's great fun creating your own lists and exploring other people's lists!</p>

					<h3>Your Home Blysty Page</h3>
					<p>When you first log in to Blysty, you’ll see your Blysty feed—it’s a collection of Blysts that we’ve picked for you plus Blysts from the people you follow or from topics you’ve shown an interest in. It’s great fun looking at other Blyster’s Blysts (user’s lists) to see what other people have Blysted. If you discover a Blyst that looks useful or interesting simple save it to one of your BlystBoards.</p>

					<p>For instance, if you are just hanging out on Blysty and you see a new posting for Mystery Novels and you are a big Mystery Novel fan, simply save that list and when you’re ready for some ideas of what to read next, you’ll find it on your BlystyBoard.</p>

					<h3>What’s a Blyst?</h3>
					<p>A Blyst is a list that you as a Blyster make and keep on one of your BlystBoards. A Blyst can have as few as one item or as many as 50. Each Blyst has a photo of something associated with the list to give it visual interest. With every Blyst you label it with one of Blysty’s major categories. That helps other Blysters find your list and does the same for you. You can make a Blyst for almost anything you can think of from your favorite vacation spots to your favorite San Francisco restaurants to your favorite Beatles songs. Or a Blyst can be your favorite chocolate desserts or of the things that you want to accomplish this year or even your grocery list. Any list can be a Blyst!</p>

This is where you can really be in charge of your life in lists and where you can really discover what makes you tick. Eventually you’ll have Blysts for all the things that are interesting or important to you, from your favorite poetry to your favorite types of dogs to even your least favorite Bachelors from the TV show The Bachelor.
