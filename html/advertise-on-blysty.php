					<p>Blysty is an incredible place to advertise since the advertising is a native part of the page and is in the format that matches the online content.</p>

					<p>And, as research shows, lists are the best way to communicate thoughts and ideas:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Lists appeal to our general tendency to categorize things. This type of organization facilitates both immediate understanding and later recall.</li>
						<li>Because we can process information more easily when it’s in a list than when it’s clustered and undifferentiated, like in standard paragraphs, a list feels more intuitive. In other words, lists simply feel better.</li>
						<li>Research has concluded that more information and options we have, the worse we feel. When the amount of conscious work we have to do in order to process something is reduced <strong>the faster we decide on something, whether it’s what we’re going to eat or where we’re going on vacation, the happier we become.</strong></li>
						<li>The list promises a definite ending: we think we know what we’re in for, and the certainty is both alluring and reassuring. The more we know about something—including precisely how much time it will consume—the greater the chance we will commit to it.</li>
						<li>The process is self-reinforcing: we recall with pleasure that we were able to complete the task (of reading the article) instead of leaving it undone and that satisfaction, in turn, makes us more likely to click on lists again</li>
						<li>In the current media environment, a list is perfectly designed for our brain. We are drawn to it intuitively, we process it more efficiently, and we retain it with little effort.</li>
					</ul>
